Instructor: Andrew Ng

#Introduction
This repo contains the full project and labs completion of Deep learning Specialization on Coursera

#What I want to say
#Verbose content warning, only refer to this document as study guide of for help, don't pliagiarize any of the code here
I know as pprogrammers and software engineers we need to study together and no matter your geographical location we needs to connect with one another and that is the main why I have created this repo just so we can all learn and improve our code significantly, feel free to create a pull request to update any changes to this repo, but copying the code to pass the class is prohibited
